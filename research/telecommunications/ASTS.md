## Technology

### BlueBird Satellites

The BlueBird satellites are the core of AST SpaceMobile's constellation:

- **BlueBird 6** (launched December 24, 2025): Largest commercial communications array ever deployed in Low Earth Orbit
  - Spans nearly 2,400 square feet (3x larger than BlueBirds 1-5)
  - Over 10x the capacity of previous satellites
  - Peak data rates up to 120 Mbps directly to unmodified phones
  - Supports voice, full data, and video applications

### Proprietary Technology

- **AST5000 ASIC**: Custom chip representing 150 person-years of R&D
  - Delivers up to 120 Mbps per coverage cell
  - Supports more than 2,000 cells per satellite
- **Patented Gateway Technology**: Compensates for signal delay and Doppler effect in real-time

### Spectrum Strategy
- 3GPP cellular spectrum augmented with L-Band
- Recently acquired 60 MHz of global S-Band priority rights
- Uses AT&T and Verizon's 850 MHz spectrum for U.S. coverage

## Risks & Challenges

### Competition (Starlink)
- SpaceX's Starlink Direct to Cell represents the primary competitive threat
- Starlink has massive lead in satellite deployment and manufacturing infrastructure
- T-Mobile partnership for Starlink Direct to Cell in the U.S.
- SpaceX acquired spectrum licenses from EchoStar

### Execution Risks
- Complex satellite design, manufacture, and launch operations
- Historical delays and cost overruns in satellite industry
- Regulatory approval requirements across multiple jurisdictions
- Scaling from successful tests to full deployment of 168+ satellites

### Financial Risks
- Not expected to generate free cash flow until 2028-2029
- Significant capital burn rate
- Potential for dilutive financing if delays occur
- Operating margin: -1,479.47% (pre-revenue stage)

### Analyst Concerns
- Scotiabank downgrade to Sell (January 7, 2026)
- Cited: competition from Starlink, slow customer adoption, launch delays
- Stock fell 12.06% following downgrade
- Pomerantz Law Firm investigation announced

---

## Growth Catalysts & Milestones

### Near-Term (2026)
- 5 orbital launches targeted by end of Q1 2026
- Launches every 1-2 months thereafter
- Target: 45-60 satellites in orbit by end of 2026
- Manufacturing 40 satellites by early 2026

### Recognition
- TIME Magazine Best Inventions 2025 (BlueBird satellite design)

## Investment Thesis

### Bull Case
- First-mover in space-based direct-to-cell broadband
- Massive TAM: 5 billion underserved mobile users globally
- $3.2B liquidity provides runway for execution
- Blue-chip partnerships validate technology
- Contracted revenue provides visibility

### Bear Case
- Starlink competition with superior scale and resources
- Pre-revenue company with massive losses
- Execution risk on complex satellite deployments
- Dilution risk if additional capital needed
- Regulatory uncertainty across jurisdictions
